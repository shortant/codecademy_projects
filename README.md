# Educational Python Elements: Jupyter Notebook Repository #
This repository contains selections from CodeCademy’s Python And Data Science Course. The intent of this collection is a display of practice and educational progress through the program. Inside contain various projects constructed in Jupyter notebook displaying visualization, cleaning, functions, and loops implemented in practical and applicable styles. 

### Decoder Notebook ###
My message decoder is a simple display of looping an object (string) through a system and modifying their values to output a new value. The original message was coded into a caesar cypher and replaced from the for loop to reveal a hidden message.

### Biodiversity Notebook ###
My Biodiversity project is a specific drill down into the shrew family’s population through various national parks. This project is an example of reorganizing an original data file’s structure to create valuable insights to specific questions. There is a massive amount of data to sift through, and drilling down into the specificities of each of a particular organism required critical thinking to redirect the data flow for new insights not found in the original dataset. Using plotting functions and groupings, the protection and endangerment rate could be drilled down into each species, and its respective parks.

### Filter Notebook ###
The filter Notebook is a simple exercise in identifying specific object categories, and applying a lambda function in practical use to filter objects in a data frame. While short, it does indicate more advanced techniques in python like the lambda function and its post-application in future created code.
The final project in this repository is the life expectancy gdp python file. Inside includes various visualization techniques within the seaborn and matplotlib library including subplots, multiplots, violin, and a wide variety of more applicable bars to produce results within python. 


Separately these projects may have a smaller significance, but were a crucial stepping stone into the furtherment of education into Python and the data science role. More advanced and completed projects may also be found on my profile in the remaining pinned libraries!
